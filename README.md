#### Environment
```
1. Using Svlete 5 with Typescipt v4
2. libs:
  parser - for converting inputs,
  operations - for performing transform tasks,
  analyzer - for graph theoretical analysis
```

#### Setup 
```
git clone <repo>
pnpm run dev
```

#### Features
```
1. Always a directed graph
2. Auto detects multi and simple graph
3. Traverse can be subgraph, but subgraph can't be traverse
4. Responsive to state changes
```

#### Future
```
1. Slow due to unoptimized use of $effect rune
2. Spaghetti input validation
3. Responsive layout breaks the container of the graphs
```
